# Online-IDE-with-Node-JS
The Integrate Development Environment (IDE) provides an environment in which to execute specific programs written in any language. An online or web-based IDE is a compiler that allows us to compile source code and execute it online in several languages. The program will be compiled by the software, and the output will be returned to the user.
